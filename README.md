#How will we walk through the exercise?
**Note that the exercise is completely optional**

We plan to run the exercises on your local machine.  We will have printed copies of the Python code to follow along in PySpark, so long as you don't mind typing.  Also included is a iPython notebook (version 3.0.0)  which can be stepped through if you install and configure IPython and configure it to execute on via PySpark.  

Below are the prerequisites:


##Install Apache Spark:
* Mac homebrew users can use brew instal apache-spark.  
* Linux and Windows users can install/build based on the following guide: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html

##Download the Data:
We will be using yelp challenge data: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset


##Installing IPython and Configuring PySpark (optional):
Cloudera has an excellent step by step walkthrough of IPython installation:

**Hint for Mac Users using HomeBrew**

`export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/apache-spark/1.3.0/libexec/`
